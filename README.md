Node Seppuku
================

`
"My life wasn't such a waste I'd decided. I'd served many exotic web browsers and processed many curious workloads. Perhaps my uptime wasn't what I had hoped for, but I had made the most of it. This, I thought to myself as my final daemons began to leave my memory, is all a node can really ask for. Halt." - Kel Cecil @kelcecil
